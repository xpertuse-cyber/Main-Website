    question: "What are the common pricing models, and which is best for my project?",
    answer: "We offer three main pricing models: Fixed Price (ideal for well-defined projects with clear scope), Hourly Rate/Time & Materials (perfect for agile projects requiring flexibility), and Retainer Agreements (best for ongoing partnerships). For complex projects, we recommend our hybrid model with a fixed-price Discovery phase followed by milestone-based development to minimize risk and ensure strategic alignment."

    category: "Pricing & Payment", 
    question: "What is a typical payment schedule for a web development project?",
    answer: "For small to medium projects, we typically use a 50% upfront deposit with 50% due upon completion. For larger projects, we implement milestone-based payments tied to specific deliverables: Project Kickoff/Deposit, Wireframes & Architecture Approval, Final Design Approval, Development Beta Completion, and Final Payment upon Launch. This ensures steady progress and aligns payments with delivered value."

    category: "Pricing & Payment",

Our standard invoicing terms are Net 30, with early payment discounts available. For larger enterprise clients, we can accommodate customized payment terms and multi-currency transactions."

    category: "Pricing & Payment",
    question: "Are there any hidden costs I should be aware of?",
    answer: "We maintain complete transparency in our pricing. All potential additional costs are disclosed upfront, including third-party services (premium plugins, APIs, stock assets), domain and hosting fees, ongoing maintenance, content population services, and any scope changes. We provide detailed estimates and require approval before proceeding with any additional work."
  },
  {
    category: "Project Process",
    question: "What is your development process, and what level of involvement is required from my team?",
    answer: "Our structured process includes Discovery, Strategy, Design, Development, Quality Assurance, Launch, and Support phases. Your involvement is most intensive during Discovery (providing business insights and requirements) and approval stages. We require timely feedback at key milestones, content provision, and formal approvals for wireframes and designs to maintain project timelines."
  },
  {
    category: "Project Process",
    question: "How is the final product delivered, and what is included in the handover package?",
    answer: "Our comprehensive handover package includes complete source code with repository access, detailed technical documentation, all administrative credentials, user training materials, and a final project report. We ensure you have everything needed to fully own and manage your digital asset, including architecture diagrams and deployment guides."
  },
  {
    category: "Project Process", 
    question: "Who owns the website, source code, and design assets after the project is paid for?",
    answer: "Upon full and final payment, you obtain 100% ownership of all intellectual property created specifically for your project. Our contracts include explicit 'work for hire' language ensuring complete ownership transfer. The only exception is our pre-existing proprietary tools, for which you receive a perpetual license to use as part of your website."
  },
  {
    category: "Project Process",
    question: "What is the typical timeline for a project like mine?",
    answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity: Simple brochure websites (4-8 weeks), Custom corporate websites (3-6 months), E-commerce platforms or custom applications (6-12+ months). We provide detailed timeline estimates with milestone breakdowns during our Discovery phase, clearly identifying dependencies and client approval points."
  },
  {
    category: "Technical Infrastructure",
    question: "How do you handle domain registration and management? Should I own my domain?",
    answer: "Yes, you should always own your domain directly. We guide you through selecting a reputable registrar and creating your own account, ensuring legal ownership. We then work with delegated access to manage DNS records and technical configurations while you maintain complete control over this critical business asset."
  },
  {
    category: "Technical Infrastructure",
    question: "What are my hosting options, and what do you recommend?",
    answer: "We offer three hosting models: Client-Managed (you control everything), Agency-Managed (we handle hosting as a service), and Platform-as-a-Service (integrated platforms like Shopify). For most clients without technical staff, we recommend our Agency-Managed hosting for optimized performance, security, and simplified support through a single point of contact."
  },
  {
    category: "Technical Infrastructure", 
    question: "What is your process for deploying the website/app and making it live?",
    answer: "Our deployment process ensures zero downtime through careful staging and testing. We use a staging environment for final testing, prepare the production server, migrate files and databases, conduct final testing on the live server using temporary URLs, and only update DNS records after confirming everything works perfectly. This gradual transition prevents any service interruption."
  },
  {
    category: "Maintenance & Support",
    question: "Do you offer monthly maintenance plans, and what is typically included?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide tiered maintenance plans essential for security and performance. All plans include software updates, security monitoring, regular backups, and uptime monitoring. Our Basic plan covers technical essentials, Growth plan adds monthly support hours, and Premium plan includes advanced optimization, SEO monitoring, and dedicated account management."
  },
  {
    category: "Maintenance & Support",
    question: "How do you handle urgent support requests or website emergencies?",
    answer: "We maintain formal Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with guaranteed response times based on your maintenance tier. Emergency situations (site down, security breaches) receive immediate priority with dedicated support channels. Our crisis management protocol includes immediate investigation, backup restoration if needed, and continuous communication throughout the resolution process."
  },
  {
    category: "Maintenance & Support",
    question: "What happens if I don't sign up for a maintenance plan?",
    answer: "Support is available on a pay-as-you-go basis at premium hourly rates with lower priority than maintenance plan clients. However, this approach is typically more expensive and less responsive than proactive maintenance. A single emergency could cost more than a year of preventive maintenance, making ongoing plans both cost-effective and strategically sound."
